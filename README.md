# Child Language Analyser
In this project, I have implemented a language analyser which investigates the linguistic characteristics of children with some form of language disorder. The analyser can perform basic descriptive statistics on a number of linguistic features in the form of visualization.


The dataset is known as ENNI 
[https://childes.talkbank.org/access/Clinical-MOR/ENNI.html]
which is a collection of narrative transcripts gathered for a clinical study carried out in Alberta, Canada, to study children with 
language disorders. Two sets of data were collected: the ﬁrst set is from children diagnosed with Speciﬁc Language 
Impairment (SLI) — one form of language disorders; and the second set is from children with the typical development (TD). 

Based on certain rules defined in the transcript, I have filtered out relevant lines using regex and then used them to clasify and 
visualize. I have made extensive use of Python Classes and Functions throughout this project.

Python packages used:

- glob
- re
- matplotlib
- numpy
